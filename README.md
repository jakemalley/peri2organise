peri2organise
=============

A organisation and management tool for school music departments.

peri2organise aims to make organising and managing extracurricular 
peripatetic music lessons easier by providing tools to easily create 
and manage lessons, notify tutors and students and take lesson registers.

peri2organise uses flask, a Python framework, to create a web application 
for tutors and students to access over the internet, login and view 
upcoming lessons.
